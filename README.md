Prototype 01:

I made this first prototype with the intent to get myself more comfortable with Unity. I wanted to start  with a walking simulator in order to practice what I learned during the past few weeks.  My main concern with this first prototype is how I could make players feel different kind of emotions through a shared universe. I created a small city, a garden and a bloody cave through different aesthetics to express my initial intents. 

Questions to playtesters: 

1.	Does the first person camera work properly? Does the camera angle and focus are suitable for the game?
2.	Does the collider bounds and rigid body of the objects work?
3.	Does the jumping control works efficiently?
4.	Is there any floating object in this game?
5.	Does the character can move around comfortably in the environments?
6.	Is there any other mechanics that needs to be improved in this game?
